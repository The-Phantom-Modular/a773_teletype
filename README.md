# Mom-series
My Mom has trouble sleeping at night, so I'm putting together a series of ambient pieces for her to relax to.
## Mom #1

Four parts, selected by knob, each part has it's own pattern (0-3)  
Each patterns contain notes, pattern 0 more basic (mostly octaves and 5ths), ranging to pattern 3, which contains more complex notes.

Script 8 stops
