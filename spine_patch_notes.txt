First finished track with the monome teletype as "sequencer"
---------------
Drums:
BD: A kick I made on plonk, here sampled and played by er-301
Perc: Quark modulated by 4r
SD/HH: er-301 emulation of a date bend sample I made for my pico drums

Bass: doepfer a-110-1, sine folded by befaco chopping kinky, saw
through humpback in BP mode with high resonance. The folder and the
filter are opened by two channels of quadra, with times modulated and
triggered by PNW with high skipping % 

Bell/EP: Rings no input (noob-mode), brigtness, damping and position
modulated by LFO and slot 

Melodic bell: Sample of a bell sound I made on a soft synth, played by
the er-301 through a custom unit inspired by Neil Parfitts "poor mans
reverb" [1] 

Lead sound: another a-110-1 through wasp, controlled by hand (pitch
from voltage on a knob through penrose quantizer, penrose triggering
quadra, release lowered by hand to end phrase). 

Sequenced from teletype, running 4 "parts", controlled by position of
knob. The bell melody is generated by the teletype, channels 6 of
voltage memory controls the probability a note will play, CCW is off. 

Reverb + delay from my axoloti.
