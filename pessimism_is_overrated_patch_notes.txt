Sequenced from teletype

BD + snare: Samples from ER-301, the snare through clocked delay,
randomly modulared

Additional percussion: Quark modulated my stepped random voltages from
teletype

Bass: ER-301 custom unit "bass pluck"

FM/bell melody: ER-301 custom unit "2op-fm", through sample rate
reduction and clocked delay, the later randomly modulated, then
through a stutter unit

Harmony: Rings (green mode) with radio music as input

Melody: Doepfer a-110 through wasp filter

Joystick (X): controls a filter on the snare and "feedback" on the
bass

Voltage Memory: Out1 controls sample rate reduction on FM/bell melody,
Out2 controls index on FM/bell melody, Out5 controls brightness on
rings, Out6 is a voltage that is the maximum of a random value added
(when button is pressed on the addac latching gates) to the melody

Latching gates: mutes track on teletype
