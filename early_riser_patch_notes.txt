sequenced from teletype

bd: synthesized on er-301
sd: synthesized on er-301
sd glitch layer: vert (modulating the internal clock at audio rate
   from a pwm square with random gain), sampled on er-301
hh: colored noise (a118), enveloped by quadra

bass: bermuda, triangle with self mod
add bass: sine from bermuda through warps (dual bit mangler),
   modulated by pams envelopes (algo), quadra (timbre), and fed the
   same v/oct as bermuda in red input

tuned glitch: samples from same session as sd glitch, sampled on er-301

bleeps: pico vco (saw) through 2lpg (tone down pos), triggers at 10ms
   (teletype) 

chords: pad from microfreak sampled in the er-301

sweep: colored noise (a118), filtered by a106-5, to monsoon (bp and hp
   to left and right), clocked my pams through ladik skipper
