Everything sequenced from the Teletype, in two scenes, selected on the
knob. CCW is the main groove, CW is a randomly generated break. For
this to work the two scenes must be saved as scene 7 and 8.

BD: Sample from braids, played by the ER-301.
SD: Sample, played by ER-301, linked to the same trigger is a ramdomly
selected glitch sample.
HH: Sample, played by ER-301.
Perc 1: Plonk through Freez
Perc 2: Pico Drums through Quark
Perc 3: Dinky's Taiko
Perc 4: No Drums

Bass: Low note is a kick from Prok, tuned to Bb, it's triggered at the
same time as the BD (but they can be muted individually)
The other part of the bass is Warps (internal oscillator) with it's
aux output going to the Befaco Chopping Kinky.

Melody: Pico VCO through Aperture

Wonky melody: Piston Honda, through a-101-2 with righ res.
